Electrical impedance for bladder state classification: Voltage data generatation scripts.
To work,the script requires: the framework EIDORS(eidors3d.sourceforge.net); and 
Bladder shape sizes from the fitted equations given in Dunne, E., Mcginley, B., O'Halloran, M. & Porter, E. A Realistic Pelvic Phantom for Electrical Impedance Measurement. Physiological Measurement (2017), in review.
